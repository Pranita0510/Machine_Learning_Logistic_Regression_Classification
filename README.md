**Logistic Regression Classification:**

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a basic implementation of Logistic Regression, a fundamental classification algorithm in machine learning. The project includes end-to-end steps required to build, evaluate, and interpret a logistic regression model.

üîç Key Features:

*Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization and summary statistics to understand dataset distribution and relationships.

*Model Building: Training a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn.

*Performance Evaluation:

  Confusion Matrix

  Accuracy Score

  Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

*Visualization of Results: Decision boundary and classification performance plots.

üì¶ Libraries Used:

pandas, numpy for data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn for visualization

sklearn for model implementation and evaluation

üìÅ Use Case:

This notebook can serve as a template or learning resource for beginners looking to understand classification tasks using logistic regression in Python.
